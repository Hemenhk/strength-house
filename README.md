# Strength House

Welcome to Strength House!

## Description

Strength House is a project designed to aid newcomers to the gym in finding an easy routine to follow. Through years of experience, I, Hemen Hiwa Kamal, have structured a simplified workout programme that allows the user to ease in to the gym. Through different pages and colors themes, the user is able to distinguish between different muscle groups. Feel free to use the routine as a template for further modifications along the way in your fitness journey!

Some of the features used in this project are meant to give the user a sense of security. For example, the hover effect on the "reasons" section (desktop only) on the home page is meant to have those reasons resonate with the user. Another example is the color changes in the hover effect of the menu lists, and the color change of the hamburger menu for each page (Push, Pull and Legs). These details are meant to provide the user with a great experience, and hopefully see them revisit the website.
