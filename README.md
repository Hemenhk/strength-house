# Strength House

Welcome to Strength House!

## Description

Strength House is a project designed to aid newcomers to the gym in finding an easy routine to follow. Through years of experience, I, Hemen Hiwa Kamal, have structured a simplified workout programme that allows the user to ease in to the gym. Through different pages and colors themes, the user is able to distinguish between different muscle groups. Feel free to use the routine as a template for further modifications along the way in your fitness journey!

Some of the features used in this project are meant to give the user a sense of security. For example, the hover effect on the "reasons" section (desktop only) on the home page is meant to have those reasons resonate with the user. Another example is the color changes in the hover effect of the menu lists, and the color change of the hamburger menu for each page (Push, Pull and Legs). These details are meant to provide the user with a great experience, and hopefully see them revisit the website.

# UX

## Strategy

Regarding the core UX principles I began contemplating the strategy behind this website and defined the target audience, and what features and technologies they would benefit most of. The user is quickly able to understand the information displayed on the home page, and the subsequent pages. The reasoning behind this project was straightforward, and has been inspired by a renowned fitness icon amongst the YouTube community, Elliott Hulse. Through his guidance in my youth, I found the neccessary tools to use in my journey. With that in mind, I wished to create a website where I could help people of similar situations begin their journey in fitness.

### Target Audience of Strength House are:

- Everyone from the ages 15 and  upwards.
- People that find fitness to be too complicated.

### User's Reasons For Using Strength House
- Wanting to commit to a fitness routine
- Wanting to increase their confidence 
- Wanting to develop discipline through continous hard work.

## Scope

To achieve the goal set in mind, this project will include:
- A header with a responsive navbar for desktop, tablets and phones.
- A home page introducing the reasons why one should pursue fitness.
- Different pages detailing a workout regiment.

## Structure

The reasons behind using a multi-page website was to give the user an opportunity to access the information in an organized and structured manner. The use of a hamburger navbar (tablet and phone users) is to allow the user to navigate the website with comfort of only one hand and without over-extending the thumb (right-hand users). By ordering the pages from Push, Pull and Legs, respectively, the user is able to understand the order of which the muscle groups should be trained (left-side priority). All pages are styled with an image relevant to the muscle groups trained, deadlift for pull and squats for legs. The "About Us" page is the only page with a single section. This was done to display a clean and simple page, describing the story behind this website. Further, the footer is simple, with only an address and social media icons, This was done, as the website is a non-commercial website that is meant to be shared freely with everyone interested. 

## Skeleton

This website is structured using 5 pages; Home, Push, Pull, Legs and About Us. All menu links are spread out over different pages, so as to give the user a sense of organization.

## Surface

I chose to give this website a more elegant feel to it, as most fitness websites are rigid. This was done to give the user a feel of competency, through the effort it took to create Strength House. The color theme of this website varies depending on the page selected. The colors were used depending on the most prominent color on the hero image. For example, in the page titled Legs, the female is wearing a suit of green, as such the hover effect and columns have been made to match it, thus giving the page a structured feel.


# Features

This is a fully responsive website. Headings from h2-h6 are styled using 'Bebas Neue', whilst the h1 is styled with 'Squada One'. This is to differentiat between the hero content and the subsequent sections. 'Noto Sans' has been used for paragraphs, as it is clean and elegant.
